## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Merges training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The CodeBook.MD file in this repository explains the data files, data cleaning and analyis steps, and variables of the output file.

The data and analysis are sourced from a UC-Irvine eperiment. Below is an explanation from the Course assignment.<br>

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
